**Senior Data Scientist** with 7+ years driving product growth through experimentation and ML at Fortune 500 companies. Built the SAFE platform scaling testing velocity from 3 to 8+ experiments/week and combined product sense, analytical rigor, and ML-driven optimization to deliver $150M+ in measurable business impact.

## WORK EXPERIENCE

**Safeway Inc.**  
*Data Scientist IV* — Pleasanton, CA  
*Feb 2024 – Present*

*   **Boosted testing velocity from 3 to 8+ experiments per week** by architecting SAFE experimentation pipeline across ingestion, processing, and visualization layers, eliminating Excel workflows.
*   **Enabled management of 17+ new metrics** (non-zero e-commerce, account health KPIs) by orchestrating integration into SAFE pipeline, expanding measurement capabilities.
*   **Migrated 70% of experimentation codebase from Snowflake to GCP BigQuery** while ensuring data integrity through comprehensive QA protocols, supporting increased scale.
*   **Reduced abandonment rate by 8+%** by enhancing opportunity sizing framework with predictive forecasting models and business metrics, enabling prioritization toward high-impact tests.
*   **Doubled annual testing capacity** by pioneering Bayesian experimentation framework that reduced test duration from 8 to ~3 weeks for 20% of experiments.
*   **Data Scientist III**
*   **Drove 40% increase in testing velocity** by designing and executing CUPED on A/B tests across Digital and In-Store categories. Reduced test variance, enabling faster time to statistical power and quicker decision cycles.
*   **Accelerated ad-hoc analysis by 90+%** by implementing AI-powered querying via GeminiAPI, enabling natural language data exploration.

**Discover Financial Services**  
*Senior Data Scientist* — Chicago, IL  
*Aug 2022 – Oct 2023*

*   **Generated $114M in annual loan volume** by leveraging XGBoost analysis to prove employment verification added no predictive value, then executing an A/B test on low-risk segments that increased conversions by 300+ customers monthly through friction reduction.
*   **Enabled $1.8M in loan approvals** by identifying and resolving critical iOS bugs through funnel analysis on the Automated Loan Approval platform, collaborating with engineering and UI/UX teams to restore conversion flow.
*   **Improved customer segmentation model accuracy by 12%** by integrating GCP TensorFlow and collaborating with ML engineering team, enabling more precise risk assessment and targeted marketing strategies.
*   **Reduced infrastructure costs by 12+%** by migrating legacy SAS workflows to modular SQL queries, improving cluster efficiency and data processing performance.

**Kaizen**  
*Data Science Engineering Intern* — Atlanta, GA  
*Jun 2021 – Dec 2021*

*   **Informed 3+ marketing campaigns** by analyzing user clustering patterns to uncover distinct customer journey types, translating data insights into actionable segmentation strategies.
*   **Reduced authentication false positives by 13%** by building ETL pipelines and deploying an anomaly detection model on AWS SageMaker, adding risk-based flagging to enhance 2FA security.
*   **Improved forecasting accuracy by 8.5%** by designing a hybrid time-series model integrating Prophet and LSTM for Toyota sales prediction, outperforming baseline statistical models.

**Vodafone**  
*Assistant Manager, Data Science* — Pune, IN  
*Jun 2016 – Feb 2019*

*   **Increased marketing revenue by $11.2M and improved CTR by 28%** by orchestrating email personalization using logistic regression to optimize content targeting, then A/B testing new campaign strategies.
*   **Enhanced customer lifetime value by 5%** by developing Linear Regression models to optimize subscription pricing based on user data and predicted retention patterns across customer segments.
*   **Increased subscription revenue by 28%** by developing retention prediction models and recommending country-specific pricing strategies, collaborating with product teams to inform roadmap and go-to-market planning.
*   **Senior Executive, Data Science**
*   **Enabled real-time performance tracking across 10+ models** by partnering with product teams to define and instrument 15+ custom metrics, building SQL pipelines and executive dashboards for new feature evaluation.
*   **Reduced Priority 2 production issues by 60+%** by developing Tableau dashboards with time series forecasting alerts, enabling proactive incident detection and faster resolution.

## Awards & Projects

**quizBeef – LLM-Powered Quiz App**
